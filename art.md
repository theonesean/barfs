## Thoughts

Art isn’t *things*, it’s a *quality we assign* to things. The assignation is the important part. How does that assignation interact with the way we perceive the web, uniquely (or not), as a tool? Is there a relationship that exists that could be called "perceiving-website-as-art" that's distinct from "perceiving-website" and "perceiving-art", a relationship or action that involves the assignation of the quality of art to an object that is a website?

Collage is a device and a medium, but here it’s being used exclusively as a device in another medium. The construction of a website involves a great deal of a process reasonably analagous to constructing collage. However, the construction deals with a text (the source code) that's abstracted from what it produces (the site/artwork itself). 

[**TODO**: motivate that the source code is itself a text, related to the work of art, but not the same as it. keywords: abstraction, structure, function]

How do we engage with website-as-art, from a phenomenological perspective?
